# Data mapping and visualisation: enhancing peacebuilding and conflict resolution

*Part of the [PeaceTech in Action](..) event*

Data science and tech can play a vital role in amplifying and bringing to life the important behind-the-scenes work done by peace and conflict specialists and activists. This workshop explores the value of data mapping and visualisation and its impact of conflict and peace research in the media, on policy making and on peace activism. Case studies include its use by the Institute of Economics and Peace and the use of data science in work on smart cities. The case study presentations will be followed by focussed breakout discussions to gather up participantsâ€™ thoughts and ideas about how to move these ideas on.

**Workshop limited to 30 people**
