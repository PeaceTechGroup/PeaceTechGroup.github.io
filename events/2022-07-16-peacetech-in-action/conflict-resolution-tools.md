# How tech professionals can design innovative conflict resolution tools

*Part of the [PeaceTech in Action](..) event*

This interactive workshop shares examples of peacetech initiatives already underway in the context of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Explore how ‘tech actors’ (tech professionals focused on peace and conflict work) play a crucial role in programming and design of peacetech tools; how artificial intelligence and virtual reality can be embedded into conflict resolution processes; and how bots for peace can be employed. Contribute your ideas on how to build a global cohort of peacetech actors.

**Workshop limited to 30 people**
