# Images from Ukraine: the strengths and dangers of visual data

*Part of the [PeaceTech in Action](..) event*

This workshop shares a unique set of images from Ukraine, gathered in 2019 - 2020 in the aftermath of the Russian attacks in the Crimea in 2014 but before the current invasion. The project used art to explore Ukrainian perceptions of the self and other, but the changing context raises challenging questions about how visual material is shared and repurposed, and the ethical dilemmas this presents for data scientists and IT professionals.
