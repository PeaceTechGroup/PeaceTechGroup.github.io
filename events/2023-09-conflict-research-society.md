## PeaceTech: the future of peacebuilding?
### Research panel

---

Within a context of growing global unrest and rapid advancements in technology, peacetech poses both opportunities and challenges for the peacebuilding community.

On the one hand, technology can help shift the balance of power by challenging existing social organisation, identities and narratives, reduce costs and access barriers and help to create real long-term benefits for those affected by conflict. On the other hand, it can provide a fertile infrastructure within which misinformation, cyber warfare and surveillance can fester undermining trust in institutions especially when it is already at a low level.

Who develops the technology, how it is used, and who can access it are all key questions for a the fast-developing field of peacetech, being driven – at least in part – by a start-up tech culture of market forces and ‘fast is good’.

This multidisciplinary panel presents four papers that illuminate where technology is or could impact peacebuilding policy, practice and and teaching at macro to micro levels, looking both its strengths and inherent vulnerabilities.
