The IPTG is an **international and interdisciplinary network** of academics, practitioners and data scientists focussed on the emerging field of *PeaceTech*.

*PeaceTech* is a broad term and still being shaped and refined across multiple contexts. For the IPTG, PeaceTech refers to the ecosystem of human-technology interactions that supports attitudes, relationships and institutions which enable living beings to flourish.

Together, the group are raising awareness of the implications of technology in both building peace and in disrupting social cohesion. We are doing this through presentations, free workshops, research projects and networking events.
