The IPTG is a newly-formed multi-disciplinary group that brings together tech professionals, conflict practitioners, researchers and academics to develop innovative tech resources and tools for peace-building efforts worldwide.

The group is working to harness the power of information technologies and the web to address some of the most challenging issues of our times, from the resolution of violent conflicts to the building of peaceful virtual and realworld communities across the globe.

The learning platform we are creating will share relevant and useful tools, methods and outputs from tech and peace and conflict perspectives.
